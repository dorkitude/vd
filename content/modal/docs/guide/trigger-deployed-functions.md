# Invoking deployed functions

Modal lets you take a function created by a [deployment](/docs/guide/managing-
deployments) and call it from other contexts.

There are two ways of invoking deployed functions. If the invoking client is
running Python, then the same [Modal client
library](https://pypi.org/project/modal/) used to write Modal code can be
used. HTTPS is used if the invoking client is not running Python and therefore
cannot import the Modal client library.

## Invoking with Python

Some use cases for Python invocation include:

  * An existing Python web server (eg. Django, Flask) wants to invoke Modal functions.
  * You have split your product or system into multiple Modal applications that deploy independently and call each other.

### Function lookup and invocation basics

Let’s say you have a script `my_shared_app.py` and this script defines a Modal
app with a function that computes the square of a number:

    import modal

    app = modal.App("my-shared-app")

    @app.function()
    def square(x: int):
        return x ** 2

Copy

You can deploy this app to create a persistent deployment:

    % modal deploy shared_app.py
    ✓ Initialized.
    ✓ Created objects.
    ├── 🔨 Created square.
    ├── 🔨 Mounted /Users/erikbern/modal/shared_app.py.
    ✓ App deployed! 🎉

    View Deployment: https://modal.com/apps/erikbern/my-shared-app

Copy

Let’s try to run this function from a different context. For instance, let’s
fire up the Python interactive interpreter:

    % python
    Python 3.9.5 (default, May  4 2021, 03:29:30)
    [Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import modal
    >>> f = modal.Function.from_name("my-shared-app", "square")
    >>> f.remote(42)
    1764
    >>>

Copy

This works exactly the same as a regular modal `Function` object. For example,
you can `.map()` over functions invoked this way too:

    >>> f = modal.Function.from_name("my-shared-app", "square")
    >>> f.map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Copy

#### Authentication

The Modal Python SDK will read the token from `~/.modal.toml` which typically
is created using `modal token new`.

Another method of providing the credentials is to set the environment
variables `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` and `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`. If you want to call a
Modal function from a context such as a web server, you can expose these
environment variables to the process.

#### Lookup of lifecycle functions

[Lifecycle functions](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) are defined on classes,
which you can look up in a different way. Consider this code:

    import modal

    app = modal.App("my-shared-app")

    @app.cls()
    class MyLifecycleClass:
        @modal.enter()
        def enter(self):
            self.var = "hello world"

        @modal.method()
        def foo(self):
            return self.var

Copy

Let’s say you deploy this app. You can then call the function by doing this:

    >>> cls = modal.Cls.from_name("my-shared-app", "MyLifecycleClass")
    >>> obj = cls()  # You can pass any constructor arguments here
    >>> obj.foo.remote()
    'hello world'

Copy

### Asynchronous invocation

In certain contexts, a Modal client will need to trigger Modal functions
without waiting on the result. This is done by spawning functions and
receiving a [`FunctionCall`](/docs/reference/modal.FunctionCall) as a handle
to the triggered execution.

The following is an example of a Flask web server (running outside Modal)
which accepts model training jobs to be executed within Modal. Instead of the
HTTP POST request waiting on a training job to complete, which would be
infeasible, the relevant Modal function is spawned and the
[`FunctionCall`](/docs/reference/modal.FunctionCall) object is stored for
later polling of execution status.

    from uuid import uuid4
    from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

    app = Flask(__name__)
    pending_jobs = {}

    ...

    @app.route("/jobs", methods = ["POST"])
    def create_job():
        predict_fn = modal.Function.from_name("example", "train_model")
        job_id = str(uuid4())
        function_call = predict_fn.spawn(
            job_id=job_id,
            params=request.json,
        )
        pending_jobs[job_id] = function_call
        return {
            "job_id": job_id,
            "status": "pending",
        }

Copy

### Importing a Modal function between Modal apps

You can also import one function defined in an app from another app:

    import modal

    app = modal.App("another-app")

    square = modal.Function.from_name("my-shared-app", "square")

    @app.function()
    def cube(x):
        return x * square.remote(x)

    @app.local_entrypoint()
    def main():
        assert cube.remote(42) == 74088

Copy

### Comparison with HTTPS

Compared with HTTPS invocation, Python invocation has the following benefits:

  * Avoids the need to create web endpoint functions.
  * Avoids handling serialization of request and response data between Modal and your client.
  * Uses the Modal client library’s built-in authentication.
    * Web endpoints are public to the entire internet, whereas function `lookup` only exposes your code to you (and your org).
  * You can work with shared Modal functions as if they are normal Python functions, which might be more convenient.

## Invoking with HTTPS

Any non-Python application client can interact with deployed Modal
applications via [web endpoint functions](/docs/guide/webhooks).

Anything able to make HTTPS requests can trigger a Modal web endpoint
function. Note that all deployed web endpoint functions have [a stable HTTPS
URL](/docs/guide/webhook-urls).

Some use cases for HTTPS invocation include:

  * Calling Modal functions from a web browser client running Javascript
  * Calling Modal functions from non-Python backend services (Java, Go, Ruby, NodeJS, etc)
  * Calling Modal functions using UNIX tools (`curl`, `wget`)

However, if the client of your Modal deployment is running Python, it’s better
to use the [Modal client library](https://pypi.org/project/modal/) to invoke
your Modal code.

For more detail on setting up functions for invocation over HTTP see the [web
endpoints guide](/docs/guide/webhooks).
