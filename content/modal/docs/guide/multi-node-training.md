# Multi-node clusters (beta)

> 🚄 Multi-node clusters with RDMA are in **private beta.** Please contact us
> via the [Modal Slack](https://modal.com/slack) or
> [support@modal.com](mailto:support@modal.com) to get access.

Modal supports running a training job across several coordinated containers.
Each container can saturate the available GPU devices on its host (a.k.a node)
and communicate with peer containers which do the same. By scaling a training
job from a single GPU to 16 GPUs you can achieve nearly 16x improvements in
training time.

### Cluster compute capability

Modal H100 clusters provide:

  * A 50 Gbps [IPv6 private network](https://modal.com/docs/guide/private-networking) for orchestration, dataset downloading.
  * A 3200 Gbps RDMA scale-out network ([RoCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDMA_over_Converged_Ethernet)).
  * Up-to 64 H100 SXM devices.
  * At least 1TB of RAM and 4TB of local NVMe SSD per node.
  * Deep burn-in testing.
  * Interopability with all Modal platform functionality (Volumes, Dicts, Tunnels, etc.).

The guide will walk you through how the Modal client library enables multi-
node training and integrates with `torchrun`.

### @clustered

Unlike standard Modal serverless containers, containers in a multi-node
training job must be able to:

  1. Perform fast, direct network communication between each other.
  2. Be scheduled together, all or nothing, at the same time.

The `@clustered` decorator enables this behavior.

    import modal
    import modal.experimental

    @app.function(
        gpu="H100:8",
        timeout=60 * 60 * 24,
        retries=modal.Retries(initial_delay=0.0, max_retries=10),
    )
    @modal.experimental.clustered(size=4)
    def train_model():
        cluster_info = modal.experimental.get_cluster_info()

        container_rank = cluster_info.rank
        world_size = len(cluster_info.container_ips)
        main_addr = cluster_info.container_ips[0]
        is_main = "(main)" if container_rank == 0 else ""

        print(f"{container_rank=} {is_main} {world_size=} {main_addr=}")
        ...

Copy

Applying this decorator under `@app.function` modifies the Function so that
remote calls to it are serviced by a multi-node container group. The above
configuration creates a group of four containers each having 8 H100 GPU
devices, for a total of 32 devices.

## Scheduling

A `modal.experimental.clustered` Function runs on multiple nodes in our cloud,
but executes like a normal function call. For example, all nodes are scheduled
together ([gang scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_scheduling)) so
that your code runs on all of the requested hardware or not at all.

Traditionally this kind of cluster and scheduling management would be handled
by SLURM, Kubernetes, or manually. But with Modal it’s all provided
serverlessly with just an application of the decorator!

### Rank & input broadcast

![diagram](https://modal-cdn.com/cdnbot/multinodepmgnla70_4b57a155.webp)

You may notice above that a single `.remote` Function call created three input
executions but returned only one output. This is how input-output is
structured for multi-node training jobs on Modal. The Function call’s
arguments are replicated to each container, but only the rank zero container’s
is returned to the caller.

A container’s rank is a key concept in multi-node training jobs. Rank zero is
the ‘leader’ rank and typically coordinates the job. Rank zero is also known
as the “main” container. Rank zero’s output will always be the output of a
multi-node training run.

## Networking

Function containers cannot normally make direct network connections to other
Function containers, but this is a requirement for multi-node training
communication. So, along with gang scheduling, the `@clustered` decorator
enables Modal’s workspace-private inter-container networking called
[i6pn](https://www.notion.so/Multi-node-
docs-1281e7f16949806f966adedfe8b2cb74?pvs=21).

The [cluster networking guide](/docs/guide/private-networking) goes into more
detail on i6pn, but the upshot is that each container in the cluster is made
aware of the network address of all the other containers in the cluster,
enabling them to communicate with each other quickly via
[TCP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/rendezvous.html).

### RDMA (Infiniband)

H100 clusters are equipped with Infiniband providing up-to 3,200Gbps scale-out
bandwidth for inter-node communication. RDMA scale-out networking is enabled
with the `rdma` parameter of `modal.experimental.clustered.`

    @modal.experimental.clustered(size=2, rdma=True)
    def train():
        ...

Copy

To run a simple Infiniband RDMA performance test see the [`modal-examples`
repository example](https://github.com/modal-labs/multinode-training-
guide/tree/main/benchmark).

## Cluster Info

`modal.experimental.get_cluster_info()` exposes the following information
about the cluster:

  * `rank: int` is the container’s order within the cluster, starting from `0`, the leader.
  * `container_ips: list[str]` contains the ipv6 addresses of each container in the cluster, sorted by rank.

## Fault Tolerance

For a clustered Function, failures in inputs and containers are handled
differently.

If an input fails on any container, this failure **is not propagated** to
other containers in the cluster. Containers are responsible for detecting and
responding to input failures on other containers.

Only rank 0’s output matters: if an input fails on the leader container (rank
0), the input is marked as failed, even if the input succeeds on another
container. Similarly, if an input succeeds on the leader container but fails
on another container, the input will still be marked as successful.

If a container in the cluster is preempted, Modal will terminate all remaining
containers in the cluster, and retry the input.

### Input Synchronization

_**Important:**_ synchronization is not relevant for single training runs, and
applies mostly to inference use-cases.

Modal does not synchronize input execution across containers. Containers are
responsible for ensuring that they do not process inputs faster than other
containers in their cluster.

In particular, it is important that the leader container (rank 0) only starts
processing the next input after all other containers have finished processing
the current input.

training-guide` repository](https://github.com/modal-labs/multinode-training-
