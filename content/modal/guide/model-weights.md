Efficiently managing the weights of large models is crucial for optimizing the
build times and startup latency of many ML and AI applications.

To store your model weights in a Volume, you need to either
make the Volume available to a Modal Function that saves the model weights
or upload the model weights into the Volume from a client.

If youâ€™re already generating the weights on Modal, you just need to
attach the Volume to your Modal Function, making it available for reading and writing:

If the model weights are generated outside of Modal and made available
over the Internet, for example by an open-weights model provider
or your own training job on a dedicated cluster,
you can also download them into a Volume from a Modal Function:

Instead of pulling weights into a Modal Volume from inside a Modal Function,
you might wish to push weights into Modal from a client,
like your laptop or a dedicated training cluster.
