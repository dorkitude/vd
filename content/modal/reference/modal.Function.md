Functions are the basic units of serverless execution on Modal.

Synchronize the local object with its identity on the Modal server.

It is rarely necessary to call this method explicitly, as most operations
will lazily hydrate when needed. The main use case is when you need to

Override the current autoscaler behavior for this Function.

Unspecified parameters will retain their current value, i.e. either the static value
from the function decorator, or an override value from a previous call to this method.
