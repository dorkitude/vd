# Modal

Modal makes it easy to deploy and scale code. To run code on Modal:

  1. Create a [Modal App](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App)
  2. Wrap a Python function with `@app.function`

Modal takes that code, puts it in a container, and runs it in the cloud.

Click **Run** to see it in action!
