All Sandboxes are associated with an App.

We start by looking up an existing App by name, or creating one if it doesn’t exist.

After starting the sandbox, we retrieve the public URLs for the exposed ports.

We can check on each server’s status by making an HTTP request to the server’s URL
and verifying that it responds with a 200 status code.

You can run this example on Modal in 60 seconds.
