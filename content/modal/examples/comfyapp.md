## Content Preview

The first inference will take ~1m since the container needs to launch the ComfyUI server and load Flux into memory. Successive calls on a warm container should take a few seconds.

Lastly, copy the ComfyUI workflow JSON to the container.

To run a workflow as an API:

Stand up a “headless” ComfyUI server in the background when the app starts.

You can run this example on Modal in 60 seconds.
