We’ve got our driver program and our code runner. Now we can create a Sandbox
and run the driver program in it.

The Sandbox and our code interpreter are stateful,
so we can define variables and use them in subsequent code.

We can also see errors when code fails.

Finally, let’s clean up after ourselves and terminate the Sandbox.
