All Sandboxes are associated with an App.

We look up our app by name, creating it if it doesn’t exist.

We define a custom Docker image that has Jupyter and some other dependencies installed.
Using a pre-defined image allows us to avoid re-installing packages on every Sandbox startup.

We’ll now wait for the Jupyter server to be ready by hitting that endpoint.

You can now open this URL in your browser to access the Jupyter notebook!
