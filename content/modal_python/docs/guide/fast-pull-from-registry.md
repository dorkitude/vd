# Fast pull from registry

The performance of pulling public and private images from registries into
Modal can be significantly improved by adopting the
[eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-
snapshotter/blob/main/docs/estargz.md) compression format.

By applying eStargz compression during your image build and push, Modal will
be much more efficient at pulling down your image from the registry.

## How to use estargz

If you have [Buildkit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/) version
greater than `0.10.0`, adopting `estargz` is as simple as adding some flags to
your `docker buildx build` command:

  * `type=registry` flag will instruct BuildKit to push the image after building.
    * If you do not push the image from immediately after build and instead attempt to push it later with docker push, the image will be converted to a standard gzip image.
  * `compression=estargz` specifies that we are using the [eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/estargz.md) compression format.
  * `oci-mediatypes=true` specifies that we are using the OCI media types, which is required for eStargz.
  * `force-compression=true` will recompress the entire image and convert the base image to eStargz if it is not already.

    docker buildx build --tag "<registry>/<namespace>/<repo>:<version>" \
    --output type=registry,compression=estargz,force-compression=true,oci-mediatypes=true \
    .

Copy

Then reference the container image as normal in your Modal code.

    app = modal.App(
        "example-estargz-pull",
        image=modal.Image.from_registry(
            "public.ecr.aws/modal/estargz-example-images:text-generation-v1-esgz"
        )
    )

Copy

At build time you should see the eStargz-enabled puller activate:

## Supported registries

Currently, Modal supports fast estargz pulling images with the following
registries:

  * AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
  * Docker Hub (docker.io)
  * Google Artifact Registry (gcr.io, pkg.dev)

We are working on adding support for GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).
