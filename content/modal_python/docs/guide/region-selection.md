# Region selection

Modal allows you to specify which cloud region you would like to run a
Function in. This may be useful if:

  * you are required (for regulatory reasons or by your customers) to process data within certain regions.
  * you want to reduce egress fees that result from reading data from a dependency like S3.
  * you have a latency-sensitive app where app endpoints need to run near an external DB.

Note that regardless of what region your Function runs in, all Function inputs
and outputs go through Modal’s control plane in us-east-1.

## Pricing

A multiplier on top of our [base usage pricing](/pricing) will be applied to
any function that has a cloud region defined.

**Region**| **Multiplier**
---|---
Any region in US/EU/AP| 1.25x
All other regions| 2.5x

Here’s an example: let’s say you have a function that uses 1 T4, 1 CPU core,
and 1GB memory. You’ve specified that the function should run in `us-east-2`.
The cost to run this function for 1 hour would be `((T4 hourly cost) + (CPU
hourly cost for one core) + (Memory hourly cost for one GB)) * 1.25`.

If you specify multiple regions and they span the two categories above, we
will apply the smaller of the two multipliers.

## Specifying a region

To run your Modal Function in a specific region, pass a `region=` argument to
the `function` decorator.

    import os
    import modal

    app = modal.App("...")

    @app.function(region="us-east") # also supports a list of options, for example region=["us-central", "us-east"]
    def f():
        print(f"running in {os.environ['MODAL_REGION']}") # us-east-1, us-east-2, us-ashburn-1, etc.

Copy

You can specify a region in addition to the underlying cloud,
`@app.function(cloud="aws", region="us-east")` would run your Function only in
`"us-east-1"` or `"us-east-2"` for instance.

## Region options

Modal offers varying levels of granularity for regions. Use broader regions
when possible, as this increases the pool of available resources your Function
can be assigned to, which improves cold-start time and availability.

### United States (“us”)

Use `region="us"` to select any region in the United States.

## Region selection and GPU availability

Region selection limits the pool of instances we can run your Functions on. As
a result, you may observe higher wait times between when your Function is
called and when it gets executed. Generally, we have higher availability in
US/EU versus other regions. Whenever possible, select the broadest possible
regions so you get the best resource availability.
