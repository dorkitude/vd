# Jupyter notebooks

> **Note:** This document is about running Jupyter on Modal. For our hosted
> notebooks product with real-time collaboration, see [Modal
> Notebooks](/docs/guide/notebooks-modal).

You can use the Modal client library in notebook environments like Jupyter!
Just `import modal` and use as normal. You will likely need to use
[`app.run`](/docs/guide/apps#ephemeral-apps) to create an ephemeral app to run
your functions:

    # Cell 1

    import modal

    app = modal.App()

    @app.function()
    def my_function(x):
        ...

    # Cell 2

    with modal.enable_output():
        with app.run():
            my_function.remote(42)

Copy

## Known issues

  * **Interactive shell and interactive functions are not supported.**

These can only be run within a live terminal session, so they are not
supported in notebooks.

  * **Local and remote Python versions must match.**

When defining Modal Functions in a Jupyter notebook, the Function
automatically has `serialized=True` set. This implies that the versions of
Python and any third- party libraries used in your Modal container must match
the version you have locally, so that the function can be deserialized
remotely without errors.

If you encounter issues not documented above, try restarting the notebook
kernel, as it may be in a broken state, which is common in notebook
development.

If the issue persists, contact us [in our Slack](https://modal.com/slack).

We are working on removing these known issues so that writing Modal
applications in a notebook feels just like developing in regular Python
modules and scripts.

## Jupyter inside Modal

You can run Jupyter in Modal using the `modal launch` command. For example:

    $ modal launch jupyter --gpu a10g

Copy

That will start a Jupyter instance with an A10G GPU attached. You’ll be able
to access the app with via a [Modal Tunnel
URL](https://modal.com/docs/guide/tunnels#tunnels-beta). Jupyter will stop
running whenever you stop Modal call in your terminal.

See `--help` for additional options.
