# Snapshots

Sandboxes support snapshotting, allowing you to save your Sandbox’s state and
restore it later. This is useful for:

  * Creating custom environments for your Sandboxes to run in
  * Backing up your Sandbox’s state for debugging
  * Running large-scale experiments with the same initial state
  * Branching your Sandbox’s state to test different code changes independently

## Filesystem Snapshots

Filesystem Snapshots are copies of the Sandbox’s filesystem at a given point
in time. These Snapshots are [Images](/docs/reference/modal.Image) and can be
used to create new Sandboxes.

To create a Filesystem Snapshot, you can use the
[`Sandbox.snapshot_filesystem()`](/docs/reference/modal.Sandbox#snapshot_filesystem)
method:

    import modal

    app = modal.App.lookup("sandbox-fs-snapshot-test", create_if_missing=True)

    sb = modal.Sandbox.create(app=app)
    p = sb.exec("bash", "-c", "echo 'test' > /test")
    p.wait()
    assert p.returncode == 0, "failed to write to file"
    image = sb.snapshot_filesystem()
    sb.terminate()

    sb2 = modal.Sandbox.create(image=image, app=app)
    p2 = sb2.exec("bash", "-c", "cat /test")
    assert p2.stdout.read().strip() == "test"
    sb2.terminate()

Filesystem Snapshots are optimized for performance: they are calculated as the
difference from your base image, so only modified files are stored. Restoring
a Filesystem Snapshot utilizes the same infrastructure we use to get fast cold
starts for your Sandboxes.
