# Continuous deployment

It’s a common pattern to auto-deploy your Modal App as part of a CI/CD
pipeline. To get you started, below is a guide to doing continuous deployment
of a Modal App in GitHub.

## GitHub Actions

Here’s a sample GitHub Actions workflow that deploys your App on every push to
the `main` branch.

This requires you to create a [Modal token](/settings/tokens) and add it as a
[secret for your Github Actions workflow](https://github.com/Azure/actions-
workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md).

After setting up secrets, create a new workflow file in your repository at
`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` with the following contents:

    name: CI/CD

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      deploy:
        name: Deploy
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          MODAL_TOKEN_ID: ${{ secrets.MODAL_TOKEN_ID }}
          MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET }}

        steps:
          - name: Checkout Repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Install Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: "3.10"

          - name: Install Modal
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install modal

          - name: Deploy job
            run: |
              modal deploy -m my_package.my_file

Copy

Be sure to replace `my_package.my_file` with your actual entrypoint.

If you use multiple Modal [Environments](/docs/guide/environments), you can
additionally specify the target environment in the YAML using
`MODAL_ENVIRONMENT=xyz`.
