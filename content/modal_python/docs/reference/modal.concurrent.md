Decorator that allows individual containers to handle multiple inputs
concurrently.

The concurrency mechanism depends on whether the function is async or not:

  * Async functions will run inputs on a single thread as asyncio tasks.
  * Synchronous functions will use multi-threading. The code must be thread-safe.

Input concurrency will be most useful for workflows that are IO-bound (e.g.,
making network requests) or when running an inference server that supports
dynamic batching.

When `target_inputs` is set, Modalâ€™s autoscaler will try to provision
resources such that each container is running that many inputs concurrently,
rather than autoscaling based on `max_inputs`. Containers may burst up to up
to `max_inputs` if resources are insufficient to remain at the target
concurrency, e.g. when the arrival rate of inputs increases. This can trade-
off a small increase in average latency to avoid larger tail latencies from
input queuing.

**Examples:**

    # Stack the decorator under `@app.function()` to enable input concurrency
    @app.function()
    @modal.concurrent(max_inputs=100)
    async def f(data):
        # Async function; will be scheduled as asyncio task
        ...

    # With `@app.cls()`, apply the decorator at the class level, not on individual methods
    @app.cls()
    @modal.concurrent(max_inputs=100, target_inputs=80)
    class C:
        @modal.method()
        def f(self, data):
            # Sync function; must be thread-safe
            ...

_Added in v0.73.148:_ This decorator replaces the `allow_concurrent_inputs`
parameter in `@app.function()` and `@app.cls()`.
