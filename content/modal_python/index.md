## Sub-second container starts

We built a Rust-based container stack from scratch so you can iterate as
quickly in the cloud as you can locally.

[View Docs](/docs/guide)

## Zero config files

Easily define hardware and container requirements next to your Python
functions.

[View Docs](/docs/guide/gpu)

## Scale to hundreds of GPUs in seconds

Never worry about hitting rate limits again. We autoscale containers for your
functions instantly.

[View Docs](/docs/guide/scale)

## Use Cases

### Generative AI Inference that scales with you

[View Examples](/docs/examples/trtllm_latency)

* * *

Fast cold boots

Load gigabytes of weights in seconds with our optimized container file system.

* * *

Bring your own code

Deploy anything from custom models to popular frameworks.

* * *

Seamless autoscaling

Handle bursty and unpredictable load by scaling to thousands of GPUs and back
down to zero.

### Fine-tuning and training without managing infrastructure

[View Examples](/docs/examples/llm-finetuning)

* * *

Start training immediately

Provision Nvidia A100 and H100 GPUs in seconds. Your drivers and custom
packages are already there.

* * *

Never wait in line

Run as many experiments as you need to, in parallel. Stop paying for idle GPUs
when you’re done.

* * *

Cloud storage

Mount weights and data in distributed volumes, then access them wherever
they’re needed.

### Batch processing optimized for high-volume workloads

[View Examples](/docs/examples/s3_bucket_mount)

* * *

Supercomputing scale

Serverless, but for high-performance compute. Run things on massive amounts of
CPU and memory.

* * *

Serverless pricing

Pay only for resources consumed, by the second, as you spin up containers.

* * *

Powerful compute primitives

Simple fan-out parallelism that scales to thousands of containers, with a
single line of Python.

## Features

Flexible Environments

Bring your own image or build one in Python, scale resources as needed, and
leverage state-of-the-art GPUs like H100s & A100s for high-performance
computing.

Seamless Integrations

Export function logs to Datadog or any OpenTelemetry-compatible provider, and
easily mount cloud storage from major providers (S3, R2 etc.).

Data Storage

Manage data effortlessly with storage solutions (network volumes, key-value
stores and queues). Provision storage types and interact with them using
familiar Python syntax.

Job Scheduling

Take control of your workloads with powerful scheduling. Set up cron jobs,
retries, and timeouts, or use batching to optimize resource usage.

Web Endpoints

Deploy and manage web services with ease. Create custom domains, set up
streaming and websockets, and serve functions as secure HTTPS endpoints.

Built-In Debugging

Troubleshoot efficiently with built-in debugging tools. Use the modal shell
for interactive debugging and set breakpoints to pinpoint issues quickly.

Recently built an app on Lambda and just started to use
[@modal_labs](https://x.com/modal_labs), the difference is insane! Modal is
amazing, virtually no cold start time, onboarding experience is great 🚀

Late to the party, but finally playing with
[@modal_labs](https://x.com/modal_labs) to run some backend jobs. DX is sooo
nice (compared to Docker, Cloud Run, Lambda, etc). Just decorate a Python
function and deploy. And it's fast! Love it.

[@modal_labs](https://x.com/modal_labs) continues to be magical... 10 minutes
of effort and the `joblib`-based parallelism I use to test on my local machine
can trivially scale out on the cloud. Makes life so easy!

I've realized [@modal_labs](https://x.com/modal_labs) is actually a great fit
for ML training pipelines. If you're running model-based evals, why not just
call a serverless Modal function and have it evaluate your model on a separate
worker GPU? This makes evaluation during training really easy.
